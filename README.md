# 1. Project

In this project we attempt to explore the application of deep learning techniques for image classification
by making an image classifier that recognizes if a given Art Image is generated by an AI or not.

All models have been trained with Art Images provided by the following **_dataset_** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/):
- **_Dataset_**: [AI-ArtBench](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravidussilva/real-ai-art)

The project is organized by following the next **_approach_**:
1. **Apply CNNs to each Art Style** - Classify if image of given Art Style is AI Generated or not.
2. **Apply CNNs to all Art Styles** - Classify if image from any Art Style is AI Generated or not.

**Results** obtained by running all the models are in the following report:
- [**_AI-Generated Art Detection Project_**]()

## 1.1. Dataset: [AI-ArtBench](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravidussilva/real-ai-art)
AI-ArtBench is a dataset that contains 180,000+ art images. 60,000 of them are human-drawn art that was 
directly taken from ArtBench-10 dataset and the rest is generated equally using Latent Diffusion and 
Standard Diffusion models. The human-drawn art is in 256x256 resolution and images generated using 
Latent Diffusion and Standard Diffusion has 256x256 and 768x768 resolutions respectively.

Dataset Information:
1. Folders Organization: `AI_<source_model>_<art_style>`
   1. `source_model`: Latent Diffusion (`LD`), Standard Diffusion (`SD`)
   2. `art_style`: `Art Nouveau`, `Baroque`, `Expressionism`, `Impressionism`, `Post impressionism`, `Realism`, `Renaissance`, `Romanticism`, `Surrealism`, `Ukiyo-e`
2. Total Images Count from All Art Styles:
   - `Train` Split : 155,015 
   - `Test` Split : 30,000


## 1.2. CNN - Models
In this project we have tested different types of CNNs architectures in order to perform good accuracy.

For **each Art Style**, we tested the following CNNs:
1. `CNN` - Defined by authors

2. [`VGG16`](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/) (Transfer Learning) + Flatten() + Dense(256, "relu") + Dropout(0.5) + Dense(1, "sigmoid")
3. [`VGG19`](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/) (Transfer Learning) + Flatten() + Dense(256, "relu") + Dropout(0.5) + Dense(1, "sigmoid")

For **All Art Styles**, we tested the following CNNs:
1. [`ResNet50`](https://keras.io/api/applications/resnet/) (Transfer Learning) + Flatten() + Dense(256, "relu") + Dropout(0.5) + Dense(1, "sigmoid")
2. [`InceptionV3`](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3/) (Transfer Learning) + Flatten() + Dense(256, "relu") + Dropout(0.5) + Dense(1, "sigmoid")
