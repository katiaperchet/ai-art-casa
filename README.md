# 1. Project

In this project, we explore the application of deep learning techniques to the classification 
of art styles, leveraging various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.

The project we explore the application of deep learning techniques to the classification 
of art styles by making a classifier that recognizes if a given image is generated by an AI or not.

## 1.2. Dataset: [AI-ArtBench](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravidussilva/real-ai-art)
Contains the 30 classes representing the source and the artistic style. The first 20 folders are named as below structure,

1. `AI_<source_model>_<art_style>`
   1. `source_model`: Latent Diffusion (LD), Standard Diffusion (SD)
   2. `art_style`: `Art Nouveau`, `Baroque`, `Expressionism`, `Impressionism`, `Post impressionism`, `Realism`, `Renaissance`, `Romanticism`, `Surrealism`, `Ukiyo-e` 

## 1.2. Models
In this project we have tested different types of CNNs architectures in order to perform good accuracy.

For each art style separately, the following CNNs were tested:
1. `CNN` - Defined by authors
2. [`VGG16`](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/) (Transfer Learning) + Flatten() + Dense(256, "relu") + Dropout(0.5) + Dense(1, "sigmoid")
3. [`VGG19`](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/) (Transfer Learning) + Flatten() + Dense(256, "relu") + Dropout(0.5) + Dense(1, "sigmoid")
